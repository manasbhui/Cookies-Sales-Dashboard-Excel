**DASHBOARD**

**Recommendations**
1. Chocolate Chip Cookie is the top-selling product with the highest profit margin. It is recommended to implement strategies, such as discounts and promotions, to further boost Chocolate Chip Cookie sales across all cities.

2. Fortune Cookies account for less than 4% of total sales and contribute under 3% to the total profit. It is advised to remove Fortune Cookies from the menu.

3. Sales tend to decline for all products in February, May, August, and November. Introducing promotional campaigns during the middle of each quarter could help drive sales during these low periods.

4. Green Bay in Wisconsin contributes 31% of total sales. Opening a new branch in Green Bay is recommended to capitalize on this strong performance.

5. Initially, the new branch should focus on selling Chocolate Chip, Oatmeal Raisin, and White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Cookies to streamline operations and focus on the best-performing products.
