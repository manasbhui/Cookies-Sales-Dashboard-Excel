🚀 Case Study: Driving Growth for Hardy's Cookie Company 🍪

Hardy's Cookie Company operates across five states in the US but has faced inconsistent growth in sales. To address this, I took on the challenge to analyze their sales data and recommend strategies for rapid and sustainable growth, including identifying the best city for a new branch.

🔍 Objective: The analysis was carried out using datasets on cookie types, orders, and customers from Q4 2019 through 2020 (fictitious data). The aim was to uncover insights to help the company expand effectively.

💼 Approach: Using MS Excel 2019, I followed the PMAVM process:

- Prepare: Set objectives, defined the problem, identified the data requirements, and cleaned the data.
- Model: Established relationships within the datasets to give the data a structured form.
- Analyze: Identified trends, insights, and made data-driven predictions.
- Visualize: Presented the findings through a compelling dashboard, utilizing visuals for clarity.
- Manage: Compiled the results into a user-friendly dashboard to make the insights easily accessible for stakeholders.
